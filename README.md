# Unity Extension Project

This project is made up of three tools:

1. An NPC path tool that allows you to map out the paths of NPC's without having to manually code every different section.

2. A measurement tool that allows you to measure distances in units between points in unity on each of the different axis.

3. A paint brush tool that allows you to paint prefabs (trees, bushes, buildings e.t.c.) onto the environment.
